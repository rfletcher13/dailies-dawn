PRODUCT ROADMAP: JAVVY COFFEE SHOPIFY THEME RECREATION

The objective of this project is to recreate the Shopify theme of javvycoffee.com, ensuring that the design, functionality, and user experience closely match the original site. The development will leverage Shopify’s standard theme structure and the provided tech stack to deliver a high-quality, responsive theme.

TECH STACK
- Shopify: Platform for building and managing the online store.
- Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for styling the theme.
- Liquid: Shopify’s templating language for dynamic content.
- JavaScript: For adding interactivity and enhancing user experience.
- HTML: Core markup language for structuring the theme.
- Skio Subscriptions: Integration for handling subscription-based products (code.skio.com).

DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
The theme will follow Shopify’s standard directory structure:
- assets/: Contains all theme assets (images, CSS, JavaScript files).
- config/: Stores configuration files for the theme.
- layout/: Includes layout files (e.g., theme.liquid for the main layout).
- sections/: Houses reusable sections for modular design.
- snippets/: Contains smaller, reusable code snippets.
- templates/: Includes page-specific templates (e.g., product, collection, homepage).

PROJECT PHASES AND TIMELINE
The project is divided into five phases, with an estimated total timeline of 12 weeks. Each phase includes specific tasks and deliverables to ensure steady progress toward recreating the Javvy Coffee theme.

Phase 1: Initial Setup (1 Week)
Objective: Set up the development environment and establish the basic theme structure.
Tasks:
- Configure a local Shopify theme development environment.
- Install Shopify CLI or Theme Kit for theme management.
- Create a new Shopify theme using the standard directory structure.
- Integrate Tailwind CSS into the assets/ directory with a custom configuration.
Deliverable: A functional Shopify theme skeleton with Tailwind CSS integrated.

Phase 2: Theme Styling with Tailwind CSS (3 Weeks)
Objective: Replicate the visual design of javvycoffee.com using Tailwind CSS.
Tasks:
- Analyze the original site’s design to identify key visual elements (e.g., colors, typography, layout).
- Configure Tailwind CSS to match the site’s design system (e.g., custom colors, fonts).
- Style global layout components (header, footer, navigation) using Tailwind utility classes.
- Style individual sections and components (e.g., product grids, hero sections) to mirror the original design.
Deliverable: A fully styled theme that visually aligns with javvycoffee.com.

Phase 3: Functionality Implementation (4 Weeks)
Objective: Implement the core functionalities of the theme, including product displays, cart systems, and subscriptions.
Tasks:
- Build product listing and detail pages using Liquid and Shopify’s APIs.
- Configure the cart system to integrate seamlessly with Shopify’s checkout process.
- Integrate Skio Subscriptions for subscription-based products, following code.skio.com guidelines.
- Recreate any custom features or interactions observed on the original site (e.g., filters, search).
Deliverable: A theme with fully functional core features, including subscriptions.

Phase 4: User Experience Enhancement (2 Weeks)
Objective: Enhance the theme with interactive elements and ensure responsiveness across devices.
Tasks:
- Implement interactive features (e.g., sliders, modals, animations) using JavaScript.
- Ensure all interactive elements are responsive and functional on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- Optimize performance by implementing lazy loading for images and minimizing script execution time.
Deliverable: A responsive theme with polished, interactive user experience enhancements.

Phase 5: Testing and Optimization (2 Weeks)
Objective: Test the theme for compatibility, performance, and functionality, and prepare it for deployment.
Tasks:
- Test the theme across multiple devices and browsers for compatibility.
- Conduct user testing to validate the user experience and gather feedback.
- Optimize code and assets (e.g., minify CSS/JavaScript, compress images) for faster load times.
- Verify that all features, including Skio Subscriptions, function correctly.
Deliverable: A fully tested and optimized theme ready for deployment.
